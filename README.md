# Password Strength  Tester 

This is a straightforward website that measures password strength using machine learning and a traditional password checker.
It is developed using methods for machine learning, Python, and streamlit.
Because the pickle files are greater than 25mb, I have not posted them. 

use this to install the required packages

By using pip

pip install -r requirements.txt

By using conda

conda install --file requirements.txt

However, in order for the machine learning model files to be created, you must execute each cell in the fmp.ipynb file.

You may launch the website at your local host with the command 

streamlit run .\1_ðŸ™‚Homepage.py
